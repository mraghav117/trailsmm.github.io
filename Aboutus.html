    <div class="goal">
        <p>
            Rise in electricity consumption and tariff hike has
            direct monetary impact on the consumer. Load
            shedding in non-urban areas do affect businesses
            and agricultural produce. Usage of fossil fuel for
            generation of electricity impacts environment.
            To combat the ill-effects (either in monetary or
            environmental terms) and considering the positive
            approach of government to encourage green energy,
            the Company chose to work in field of Solar
            installations, Electric Vehicles Charging and Solar
            agricultural pumps
        </p>
        <p>
            In small industries the old electrical installation
            methods and quality defy the engineering norms. The
            education and awareness in this is needed
            to prevent any mishaps. Utilising the expertise,
            the team ventures into consultancy and
            implementation of such installations. Also it was
            decided to help in automation of electrical
            processes in industries to be in pace with the
            technology.
